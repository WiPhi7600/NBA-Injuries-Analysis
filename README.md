### Motivation	
The outcome of the 2018/2019 NBA season was largely shaped by a rash of devasting injuries to star players (_see pictures below_). In recent years there **_seems_** to be an increasing number of high profile players experiencing serious injuries (ACL tear, Achilles, fractured bones), which in turn cause them to miss significant playing time, often detrimentally impacting their team's success.

### Objective
The objective of this project was to determine if serious injuries **_are_** really on this rise in the NBA, and in doing so, explore the nature of NBA injuries during past decade. For the purposes of this analysis we nominally define "serious injuries" as those causing a player to miss 15 or more games.

### Data Sources
The website [_Prosport Transactions_ ](http://prosportstransactions.com/) maintains an open-source archive of sports transactions, including "the most complete database of pro basketball transactions available". For the purposes of this analysis two transactions are types are particularily useful: 
  * Movement to/from injured/inactive list (IL)
  
   * Normally an NBA team can have a maximum of 15 players on its roster during a season,  A team normally has 12 or 13 players on its Active List, who are eligible to play in games, and can have as few as 11 for up to two weeks at a time. Any remaining players must be on the team's Inactive List, and are ineligible to play in games.
   
  * Missed games due to injury/personal reasons


1. Scrape Data

2. Clean Data

### Data Challenges

Analysis of historical NBA injury data is hindered by the lack of a NBA does not maintain a database of injury history. In

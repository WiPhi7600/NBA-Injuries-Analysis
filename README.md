### Motivation	

The outcome of the 2018/2019 NBA season was largely shaped by a rash of devasting injuries to star players (Pictured above: (L) Kevin Durant's achilles tear; (R) Klay Thompson's torn MCL in the NBA Finals). In recent years it SEEMS like an increasing number of high profile players are experiencing serious injuries (ACL tear, Achilles, fractured bones), causing them to miss significant playing time.

The objective of this project was to determine if serious injuries ARE really on this rise in the NBA, and in doing so, explore the nature of NBA injuries during past decade.
